To-Do List 4/21/17

     -move certain parts back to decode stage (branch prediction)
     -implement the clock
    - branch predictions/forwarding (3)
     -jump instructions -> how?
     -nop -> how? sll 0000 {czech}
     -add in pipeline registers + shadow registers (if time)
     -mem and writeback stage (today)
     -figure out logic behind lb lbu etc
     -unsigned vs signed operations -> overflow?
     -control line -> set stuff
    -ALU error detection
    -find functions that used to take in the non-sign extended field for imm. we took out the function input so it might not work
    -weird nor instruction comment 
    -check if jump instruction should make the rest of the instructions
    -print statement: overflow
    -set control lines
